        "answer": "AI confidence scores range from 0 to 1 and indicate how certain the AI is about its diagnosis. Scores above 0.8 are considered high confidence and typically indicate reliable diagnoses. Lower scores may require human review before taking automated actions.",

        "question": "How does the incident detection work?",
        "answer": "Our system monitors your applications for anomalies and incidents. When an incident is detected, it's sent to our AI engine for analysis. The AI diagnoses the issue, assigns a confidence score, and suggests remediation actions based on your configured guardrails.",
